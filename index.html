            <h1>Eilean Donan Castle</h1>
            <p>The castle's history dates back to at least 643 AD, though the current structure was built in the 13th century by the MacRae clan. After being destroyed in the 18th century, it was meticulously restored between 1919 and 1932 by Lieutenant Colonel John MacRae-Gilstrap, who also added a war memorial dedicated to clan members who died in World War I. Today, Eilean Donan Castle stands as a testament to Scotland's rich heritage, drawing visitors from around the world to admire its blend of natural beauty and historical significance.</p>
